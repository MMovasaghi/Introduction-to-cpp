# Home Works
Home works are some excersises for lernning programming better , so we have some level :<br/> **A** :   A Level **is nessecery** for every one , and it is **easy**.<br/> **B** :   B Level **is nessecery** for every one , but it is **not easy**.<br/> **C** :   C Level **is not nessecery** for every one , and it is **innovative**.
